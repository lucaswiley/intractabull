When Silicon Valley Bank was imploding a few months ago, I caught up with a colleague from California whose company banked significantly with them. He was facing the prospect of losing his job.

His response: “I kinda hope things go south; life needs a shakeup.”

Beautiful. Embrace change. Trust that there is a plan and that you are doing everything you can to solve your mission in life.

If you don’t have a mission - search relentlessly for it. Your future self will thank you. 

Teddy Roosevelt once said that those with privilege must live a [strenuous life](https://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/roosevelt-strenuous-life-1899-speech-text/) - for the greater good.

Mistakes and failure have often been the biggest catalysts for the mild success I have in my life.

Here is my ode to a lifetime of failures, successes, many lessons learned, lower lows, and higher highs.

Lessons for a lifetime:

* Be kind to others and reach out as often as you can
* Create something meaningful for yourself
* Don’t complain - Instead fix or learn
* Take more risks
* Fall in love with problems, ideas, and people as often as you can - you will learn
* Don’t be afraid to disagree - they will respect you more for it
* Spend more conversations asking questions - not stating what you know
* Proactively help others - karma will thank you
* Don’t expect people to come to you. They are busy. You need to reach out.
* Unrelenting curiosity (and execution) is the difference between zero and one
